  <h1>Australia Wildfire Data Visualization</h1>

      <p>This visualisation looks at how climate factors influence bushfire activity across Australia. 
      It combines data on temperature, rainfall, and planned burns to show how different weather conditions and management efforts 
      impact the total area burned each year and across states. From the visuals, we can see clear patterns, hotter and drier years 
      lead to more intense fires, while cooler and wetter years have fewer and smaller fires.</p>
      <p>The goal of this project is to highlight trends, seasonal changes, and areas most at risk, helping guide better fire planning 
      and prevention in the future. It’s made for students, researchers, policy makers, and anyone who wants to understand bushfire 
      behaviour. The dashboard turns complex data into clear visuals, making it easy for everyone to see how changes in climate affect 
      the scale and severity of Australia’s bushfires.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Australia — Total Wildfire Burnt Area by State (2011–2020, kilohectares)</h2>
    <div id="chart1" class="chart"></div>

    <div class="story">
      <p>Western Australia (WA) and the Northern Territory (NT) dominate the map with the darkest tones, showing they experienced the largest burnt areas between 2011 and 2020. 
      In contrast, Tasmania (TA) and Victoria (VI) remain pale, indicating smaller fire impact.</p>
      <p>This uneven distribution reflects regional differences in vegetation, climate, and land-management practices. The story of bushfire in Australia isn’t uniform — it varies sharply from one state to another.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Relationship between Rainfall and Burnt Area (2011–2017)</h2>
    <div class="chart-with-story">
      <div id="chart2" class="chart"></div>
      <div class="story">
        <h3>Understanding the Rainfall–Fire Relationship</h3>
        <p>This chart explores the correlation between rainfall and burnt area across years.
        Each bubble represents a specific state-year combination, sized by the total burnt area.
        The trendline suggests a negative correlation: in general, states with lower rainfall tend to experience higher burnt areas.</p>
        <p>However, outliers such as Queensland (QLD) in wet years indicate that rainfall alone cannot fully explain bushfire severity — land dryness, vegetation type, and wind conditions also play crucial roles.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Trend of Total Forest Area Burnt (2011–2020)</h2>
    <div class="chart-with-story reverse">
      <div class="story">
        <h3>Long-Term Burnt Area Trend</h3>
        <p>This line chart illustrates the temporal trend of total burnt area across all states.
        The curve shows noticeable fluctuations, with relatively stable levels from 2011 to 2018, followed by a dramatic surge in 2019, corresponding to the <strong>Black Summer bushfires</strong> — one of the most catastrophic fire seasons in Australia’s history.</p>
        <p>The decline in 2020 indicates recovery efforts and more favorable climate conditions after the peak disaster year. This long-term view highlights how bushfire activity responds to both climatic variability and human intervention.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="chart3" class="chart"></div>
    </div>

    <h2>Planned vs Unplanned Forest Fire Area (2011–2020)</h2>
    <div class="chart-with-story">
      <div id="chart4" class="chart"></div>
      <div class="story">
        <p>The stacked bars differentiate between planned burns (blue) and unplanned fires (red).
        Planned burns, used as a hazard reduction strategy, remain relatively constant, while unplanned fires fluctuate significantly.</p>
        <p>The spike in unplanned fire area in 2019 highlights the uncontrollable nature of that season’s fires, emphasizing the limits of preventive strategies under extreme conditions.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Seasonal Fire Intensity Heatmap (2011–2020)</h2>
    <div class="chart-with-story reverse">
      <div class="story">
        <h3>Seasonal Fire Intensity Patterns</h3>
        <p>The heatmap displays seasonal fire intensity across months and years.
        Darker shades reveal months of heightened fire activity—typically between September and February, aligning with Australia’s dry summer period.</p>
        <p>This visualization demonstrates the cyclical, seasonal nature of bushfires, reinforcing the need for targeted preparedness in late spring and summer.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="chart5" class="chart"></div>
    </div>

    <h2>Monthly Temperature Candlestick (2011–2017)</h2>
    <div class="chart-with-story reverse">
      <div class="story">
        <h3>Temperature and Fire Seasonality</h3>
        <p>This chart shows how temperatures (Min, Max, Median) change across the year. The summer months (Dec–Feb) have much higher and wider temperature ranges, which dry out the land and make fires more likely.</p>
        <p>In winter (Jun–Aug), temperatures are lower and more stable, so there’s less heat and less fire activity.</p>
        <p>It helps show how temperature patterns directly affect when and how strongly bushfires happen.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="chart6" class="chart"></div>
    </div>

    <h2>Proportion of Burnt Area by State (2011–2020)</h2>
    <div class="chart-with-story">
      <div id="chart7" class="chart"></div>
      <div class="story">
        <h3>State-Level Burnt Area Proportion</h3>
        <p>The donut chart provides a proportional overview of how much each state contributed to the total burnt area over the decade.</p>
        <p>Western Australia (WA) and the Northern Territory (NT) account for the majority, together exceeding 60% of total area burned.</p>
        <p>This visualization effectively summarizes the spatial imbalance highlighted in the choropleth map, linking it to the overall national picture.</p>
